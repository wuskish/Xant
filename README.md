## 📌 Overview

**Xant** is an automated Telegram Userbot script powered by [Telethon](https://github.com/LonamiWebs/Telethon). It bypasses content protection restrictions (`has_protected_content`) on private Telegram channels where saving or forwarding media is prohibited.

Simply forward or paste post links into your **Saved Messages**, and **Xant** will process them in sequence, download the files directly from Telegram servers, and send them back to you.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🔓 **Bypass Restricted Content:** Download photos, videos, and documents from channels with restricted saving/forwarding.
- 📦 **Batch Processing:** Send multiple post links in a single message - Xant will queue and process them one by one.
- 📊 **Real-Time Progress Tracking:** Shows downloading percentage, transferred data (MB), and remaining total size.
- 🛡️ **Network Resilience:** Built-in connection retry mechanism to handle TCP disconnects and network drops gracefully.
- ⏱️ **Anti-FloodWait Protection:** Smart status update throttling (2-second interval) to comply with Telegram API rate limits.
- 🧹 **Auto-Cleanup:** Automatically deletes downloaded temporary files from storage once delivered.
